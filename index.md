### What is OpenMagneto?

The goal of the Southwest Magnetogenetics technology hub (SoMa) is to create a next-generation
neuromodulation technology that can modulate the activity of targeted cells throughout the
entire brain using magnetic fields that freely penetrate bone and tissue. The key to this new
technology is our recent discovery of a new biophysical mechanism – the biological
magnetocaloric effect – that can heat and cool ion channels based on changes in magnetic
entropy. The understanding of this effect provides us with a unique rational approach for
creating a diverse suite of “magnetogenetic” ion channels, referred to as “MAgnetoCaloric
Switches” (MACS) that can be completely genetically encoded in a variety of model organisms.
